# Crowdfunding-Analyses

1.	The purpose of this analysis is to compare how different campaigns prospered in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. By looking at the “Theatre outcomes by lunch date”, we can see that the month of May has a greater success rate, followed by the month of June. On the other hand, the months of January, June, July, and October all have almost the same rate of number of failed campaigns launched.

2.	The challenge that I faced was to create the table based on goals outcome. I couldn’t figure out the formula to calculate the number of successful, failed and canceled campaign. I difficult with   the concept of “range and criteria”. But, after watching a gazillion times the illustration video, I finally figured it out.

3: 

  A) The conclusion based on the outcomes by launch date is that the month of may is the most successful one. 

  B)  The conclusion based on outcomes by the goals is that all campaigns run under $1000 have 100% 0f successful rate.
  
  C) The data is limited to 2017 , so we need more recent data to see what the trends are. One suggestion for an additional chart would be a box and the whisker charts to look more closely at outliners.
